This shows how API is created using Python and how it can perform CURD.

The project is to create an API to access the items of the E-Commerce Website. I built the API link and tested it using Postman, it is a platform used for API testing. I tested CRUD operations through the same.  In this project, I also created a HTML page to show background functionalities in Visual Representation. The page is dynamically designed and styled using CSS.
Python (Flask) have been used to create this entire project.
